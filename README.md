My thesis on imputing missing data in GPS measurements. 

## The Problem briefly

Everyone wants to do big data but real world smartphone location measurements are very messy. In order to draw accurate conclusions and build useful models we need to be able to deal with high levels of measurement error and missing data.

![Raw GPS measurements of a journey from de Uithof to Tuinwijk on February 17th 2017. The measurements are in red, the filtered path is in blue. The circles denote 67% confidence intervals of the given GPS measurement. Measurements and fitted points which follow each other in time are connected by lines. The inaccurate measurements lead to estimates of irregular movements. The filtered movement estimate is less volatile, but lags behind the unfiltered movement.](Map1.png)
