# Missing data in GPS measurements

This is the research archive necessary to make my thesis reproducible.

This archive contains:

1. The files needed to render the pdf version of the manuscript.
2. The scripts and functions needed to reproduce or replicate my results.

This archive does not contain:

1. Sensitive personal data, including smartphone location logs.
2. Scripts written by others but nonetheless used in preparing the thesis, such as the MATLAB scripts of Palmius & the functions prepared by Barnett & Onnella. 

The files are:

[Correspondance](\correspondance): emails exchanged about the state of the thesis at different points.
[Palmius Implementation](\PalmiusImplementation): Implementing the method of Palmius and getting subsequent results.
[PPMI](\PPMI): PPMI implementation and objective results. 
[scripts](\scripts): 
[Thesis Manuscript](\thesis_manuscript): the files necessary to produce the text.
[Thesis Report](\thesis_report): the files necessary to reproduce the thesis report submitted in 2017

Files are generally structured to contain a main script, a folder of functions and a folder of scripts. The main script and the functions are the ones necessary to reproduce all results. The folder of scripts contains exploratory scripts written to wrangle data, test sub-hypotheses and contain research dead-ends that did not lead to desired results. What did work was prepared in the form of functions within the functions folders.
