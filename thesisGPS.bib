	abstract = {Trip underreporting has long been a problem in household travel surveys because of the self-reporting nature of traditional survey methods. Memory decay, failure to understand or to follow survey instructions, unwillingness to report full details of travel, and simple carelessness have all contributed to the incomplete collection of travel data in self-reporting surveys. Because household trip survey data are the primary input into trip generation models, it has a potentially serious impact on transportation model outputs, such as vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and travel time. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has been used as a supplement in the collection of personal travel data. Previous studies confirmed the feasibility of applying GPS technology to improve both the accuracy and the completeness of travel data. An analysis of the impact of trip underreporting on modeled VMT and travel times is presented. This analysis compared VMT and travel time estimates with GPS-measured data. These VMT and travel time estimates were derived by the trip assignment module of each region's travel demand model by using the trips reported in computer-assisted telephone inter views. This analysis used a subset of data from the California Statewide Household Travel Survey GPS Study and was made possible through the cooperation of the metropolitan planning organizations of the three study areas (Alameda, Sacramento, and San Diego, California).},

	abstract = {Many cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors impact student learning during college. The SmartGPA study uses passive sensing data and self-reports from students' smartphones to understand individual behavioral differences between high and low performers during a single 10-week term. We propose new methods for better understanding study (e.g., study duration) and social (e.g., partying) behavior of a group of undergraduates. We show that there are a number of important behavioral factors automatically inferred from smartphones that significantly correlate with term and cumulative GPA, including time series analysis of activity, conversational interaction, mobility, class attendance, studying, and partying. We propose a simple model based on linear regression with lasso regularization that can accurately predict cumulative GPA. The predicted GPA strongly correlates with the ground truth from students' transcripts (r = 0:81 and p {\textbackslash}textless 0:001) and predicts GPA within ±0:179 of the reported grades. Our results open the way for novel interventions to improve academic performance.},

Data can be collected from the onboard sensors and other phone logs embedded in today’s off-the-shelf smartphone devices. These data permit fine-grained, continuous collection of people’s social interactions (e.g., speaking rates in conversation, size of social groups, calls, and text messages), daily activities (e.g., physical activity and sleep), and mobility patterns (e.g., frequency and duration of time spent at various locations). In this article, we have drawn on the lessons from the first wave of smartphone-sensing research to highlight areas of opportunity for psychological research, present practical considerations for designing smartphone studies, and discuss the ongoing methodological and ethical challenges associated with research in this domain.

This is justified based on the fact that self-reported trip durations in traditional mobility data sources are based on travelers’ memories and perceptions, which implies that these do not necessarily coincide with real or clock time. For this purpose, the daily commute to a suburban university campus in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (Spain) is used as a case study. The app experiment points to a light under-perception of travel time, but further analyses show how misperceptions are especially related to the characteristics of this commute. Total trip duration has emerged as the main variable affecting the differences in reported and objective times, while different explanatory factors are suggested as accounting for the misperceptions of public transit riders and of those who drive.},

	abstract = {Handheld global positioning system (GPS) devices can serve as a new tool to collect an individual's trip information with advantages of low cost, accurate data, and intensive spatial coverage. Various machine learning algorithms have been explored to detected trip train information in previous studies; however, few of them focused on the evaluation and comparison of the performance and applicability of different models. Meanwhile, according to previous studies, car and bus mode detection is a thorny issue due to their similar travel characteristics, and algorithms still need to be well explored and improved to solve this problem. In this article, an innovative method is proposed to detect trip information, including trip modes, mode-changing time and location, and other attributes, from personal trajectory data. The method is a two-step process. A machine learning algorith-based module (including artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forests, and Bayesian network) is firstly used to identify walk, bicycle, and motorized trip modes (bus or car); we thoroughly compared the performance of these four algorithms. Then a second module, using critical points on the GPS trajectories, is further developed to distinguish car and bus mode, incorporated with GIS map information. Field test results show that the proposed machine learning models can all be applied for walk, bicycle, and motorized mode detection with high detection rates exceeding 90\%; however, the algorithms work relatively poorly for bus and car mode detection, with results mostly below 75\%. The proposed two-step method can greatly improve bus and car mode detection accuracy by 14–30\%. As a result, the average mode detection rates for all the four modes are above 90\%. Compared with mode detection results by using only the machine learning algorithm, the proposed two-step method has much better performance in both accuracy and consistency.},

	abstract = {The long-range dependence (LRD) of the stochastic part of GPS-derived topocentric coordinates change (North, East, Up) results with relatively high autocorrelation values with a focus on self-similarity. One of the reasons for such self-similarity in the GPS time series are noises that are commonly recognised to prevail in the form of the flicker noise model. To prove the self-similarity of the stochastic part of GPS time series we used more than 130 ASG-EUPOS (active geodetic network EUPOS) stations from an area of Poland with a 5-year span of the daily topocentric coordinate changes. The deterministic part of time series was removed by means of the least-squares (LS) method, median absolute deviation (MAD) criterion and the sequential t-test algorithm, respectively. Then the self-similarity of the residue was proved by the results of the Ljung–Box test, whose values close to zero showed the dependence of the stochastic part of the GPS time series. The residue was analysed by means of the rescaled range (R/S) method with the H (Hurst) parameter and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) with the scaling exponent α. Both H and α values ranged within assumed LRD limits of 0.5 and 1. This analysis was followed by noise investigation with a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The white plus the power-law noise models were assumed a priori, which gave us a spectral indices κ between − 0.4 and − 1.2 for all of the time series. It proved that fractional white noise outweighs other types of noises in GPS time series. Authors found here, that the LRD methods by omitting the noise amplitude data led to an underestimation of H values and their misinterpretation. The larger the omitted amplitude is, the greater the difference between the noise characters estimated with R/S values in comparison to the reference values of κ are. Some of these differences exceed even the value of 0.6, which may result in the estimation of false noise character in GPS data thus eliciting wrong conclusions.},

	abstract = {GPS data collection has become an important means of investigating travel behaviour. This is because such data ideally provide far more detailed information on route choice and travel patterns over a longer time period than possible from traditional travel survey methods. Wearing a GPS unit is furthermore less requiring for the respondents than filling out (large) questionnaires. It places however high requirements to the post-processing of the data. This study developed and tested a combined fuzzy logic and GIS-based algorithm to process raw GPS data. The algorithm is applied to GPS data collected in the highly complex large-scale multi-modal transport network of the Greater Copenhagen area. It detects trips, trip legs and distinguishes between five modes of transport. The algorithm was validated by comparing with a control questionnaire collected among the same persons and a sensitivity analysis was performed. This showed that the algorithm (i) identified corresponding trip legs for 82\% of the reported trip legs, (ii) avoided classifying non-trips such as scatter around activities as trip legs, (iii) identified the correct mode of transport for more than 90\% of trip legs, and (iv) were robust towards the specification of the model parameters and thresholds. The method thus makes it possible to use GPS for travel surveys in large-scale multi-modal networks.},

Methods: Anonymized geographic location recordings from 22 BD participants and 14 healthy controls (HC) were collected over 3 months. Participants reported their depressive symptomatology using a weekly questionnaire (QIDS-SR16). Recorded location data were preprocessed by detecting and removing imprecise data points and features were extracted to assess the level and regularity of geographic movements of the participant. A subset of features were selected using a wrapper feature selection method and presented to 1) a linear regression model and a quadratic generalized linear model with a logistic link function for questionnaire score estimation; and 2) a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier for depression detection in BD participants based on their questionnaire responses. Results: HC participants did not report depressive symptoms and their features showed similar distributions to nondepressed BD participants. Questionnaire score estimation using geolocation-derived features from BD participants demonstrated an optimal mean absolute error rate of 3.73, while depression detection demonstrated an optimal (median ± IQR) F1 score of 0.857 ± 0.022 using five features (classification accuracy: 0.849 ± 0.016; sensitivity: 0.839 ± 0.014; specificity: 0.872 ± 0.047). Conclusion: These results demonstrate a strong link between geographic movements and depression in bipolar disorder. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first community study of passively recorded objective markers of depression in bipolar disorder of this scale. The techniques could help individuals monitor their depression and enable healthcare providers to detect - hose in need of care or treatment.},

Here, we review a statistical approach, state–space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state–space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of GPS-enabled devices is changing the way people interact with the Web, and brings us a large amount of GPS trajectories representing people's location histories. In this paper, based on multiple users' GPS trajectories, we aim to mine interesting locations and classical travel sequences in a given geospatial region. Here, interesting locations mean the culturally important places, such as Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and frequented public areas, like shopping malls and restaurants, etc. Such information can help users understand surrounding locations, and would enable travel recommendation. In this work, we first model multiple individuals' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical graph (TBHG). Second, based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search)-based inference model, which regards an individual's access on a location as a directed link from the user to that location. This model infers the interest of a location by taking into account the following three factors. 1) The interest of a location depends on not only the number of users visiting this location but also these users' travel experiences. 2) Users' travel experiences and location interests have a mutual reinforcement relationship. 3) The interest of a location and the travel experience of a user are relative values and are region-related. Third, we mine the classical travel sequences among locations considering the interests of these locations and users' travel experiences. We evaluated our system using a large GPS dataset collected by 107 users over a period of one year in the real world. As a result, our HITS-based inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and rank-by-frequency. Meanwhile, when considering the users' travel experiences and location interests, we achieved a better performance beyond baselines, such as rank-by-count and rank-by-interest, etc.},

	abstract = {Background Uncovering the mechanism behind the scaling laws and series of anomalies in human trajectories is of fundamental significance in understanding many spatio-temporal phenomena. Recently, several models, e.g. the explorations-returns model (Song et al., 2010) and the radiation model for intercity travels (Simini et al., 2012), have been proposed to study the origin of these anomalies and the prediction of human movements. However, an agent-based model that could reproduce most of empirical observations without priori is still lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, considering the empirical findings on the correlations of move-lengths and staying time in human trips, we propose a simple model which is mainly based on the cascading processes to capture the human mobility patterns. In this model, each long-range movement activates series of shorter movements that are organized by the law of localized explorations and preferential returns in prescribed region. Conclusions/Significance Based on the numerical simulations and analytical studies, we show more than five statistical characters that are well consistent with the empirical observations, including several types of scaling anomalies and the ultraslow diffusion properties, implying the cascading processes associated with the localized exploration and preferential returns are indeed a key in the understanding of human mobility activities. Moreover, the model shows both of the diverse individual mobility and aggregated scaling displacements, bridging the micro and macro patterns in human mobility. In summary, our model successfully explains most of empirical findings and provides deeper understandings on the emergence of human mobility patterns.},

	abstract = {With increasing availability of smartphones with GPS capabilities, large-scale studies relating individual-level mobility patterns to a wide variety of patient-centered outcomes, from mood disorders to surgical recovery, are becoming a reality. Similar past studies have been small in scale and have provided wearable GPS devices to subjects. These devices typically collect mobility traces continuously without significant gaps in the data, and consequently the problem of data missingness was safely ignored. Leveraging subjects' own smartphones makes it possible to scale up and extend the duration of these types of studies, but at the same time introduces a substantial challenge: to preserve a smartphone's battery, GPS can be active only for a small portion of the time, frequently less than 10\%, leading to a tremendous missing data problem. We introduce a principled statistical approach, based on weighted resampling of the observed data, to impute the missing mobility traces, which we then summarize using different mobility measures. We compare the strengths of our approach to linear interpolation, a popular approach for dealing with missing data, both analytically and through simulation of missingness for empirical data. We conclude that our approach offers significant benefits both theoretically and in the actual performance on real-world data.},

	abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) devices have been utilised in travel surveys since the late 1990s. Because GPS devices are very accurate at recording time and positional characteristics of travel, they can correct the trip-misreporting issue resulting from self-reports of travel and improve the accuracy of travel data. Although the initial idea of using GPS surveys in transport data collection was just to replace paper-based travel diaries, GPS surveys currently are being applied in a number of transport fields. Several general reviews have been done about GPS surveys in the literature review sections in some papers, but a detailed systematic review from GPS data collection to the whole procedure of GPS data processing has not been undertaken. This paper comprehensively reviews the development of GPS surveys and their applications, and GPS data processing. Different from most reviews in GPS research, this paper provides a detailed and systematic comparison between different methods from trip identification to mode and purpose detection, introduces the methods that researchers and planners are currently using, and discusses the pros and cons of those methods. Based on this review, researchers can choose appropriate methods and endeavour to improve them.},

Yet inexpensive, pervasive positioning—a requirement for wide-scale adoption of location-aware computing—has been elusive. We demonstrate a radio beacon-based approach to location, called Place Lab, that can overcome the lack of ubiquity and high-cost found in existing location sensing approaches. Using Place Lab, commodity laptops, PDAs and cell phones estimate their position by listening for the cell IDs of fixed radio beacons, such as wireless access points, and referencing the beacons’ positions in a cached database. We present experimental results showing that 802.11 and GSM beacons are sufficiently pervasive in the greater Seattle area to achieve 20-30 meter median accuracy with nearly 100\% coverage measured by availability in people’s daily lives.},

This article begins with an overview of this transition, and argues that the spatial integration of information resources and the cross-disciplinary sharing of analysis and representation methodologies are important forces for the integration of scientific and artistic expression, and that they draw on core concepts in spatial (and spatio-temporal) thinking. We do not suggest that this is akin to prior concepts of unified knowledge systems, but we do maintain that the boundaries to knowledge transfer are disintegrating and that our abilities in problem solving for purposes of artistic expression and scientific development are enhanced through spatial perspectives. Moreover, approaches to education at all levels must recognize the need to impart proficiency in the critical and efficient application of these fundamental spatial concepts, if students and researchers are to make use of expanding access to a broadening range of spatialized information and data processing technologies.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r =-.63, P =.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r =-.58, P =.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r =-.58, P =.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated ( r =.54, P =.011, and r =.52, P =.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score \&\#8805;5) from those without (PHQ-9 score \&\#60;5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5\%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants\&\#8217; PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5\%. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.

	abstract = {Today's health care is difficult to imagine without the possibility to objectively measure various physiological parameters related to patients' symptoms (from temperature through blood pressure to complex tomographic procedures). Psychiatric care remains a notable exception that heavily relies on patient interviews and self-assessment. This is due to the fact that mental illnesses manifest themselves mainly in the way patients behave throughout their daily life and, until recently there were no "behavior measurement devices." This is now changing with the progress in wearable activity recognition and sensor enabled smartphones. In this paper, we introduce a system, which, based on smartphone-sensing is able to recognize depressive and manic states and detect state changes of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. Drawing upon a real-life dataset of ten patients, recorded over a time period of 12 weeks (in total over 800 days of data tracing 17 state changes) by four different sensing modalities, we could extract features corresponding to all disease-relevant aspects in behavior. Using these features, we gain recognition accuracies of 76\% by fusing all sensor modalities and state change detection precision and recall of over 97\%. This paper furthermore outlines the applicability of this system in the physician-patient relations in order to facilitate the life and treatment of bipolar patients.},

We try to answer the question whenever the filtering applied on higher layer of the mobile device software may improve the quality of the data provided by the GPS receiver. Two metrics are used for comparison: the average euclidean distance between the points on the GPS tracks and the actual location of the user and the area of the polygon created by intersection of the filtered and real track. We find that the Kalman filtering does not improve those two metrics and the direct use of the data provided by the GPS receiver provides track which is on average more near the real path than result of Kalman filtering. However we observe that this is caused by the errors introduced when the user change the direction and when we evaluate a parts of the path without rapid changes of direction (as e.g. crossing) the filters allow to generate the points which are more near the road taken by the user.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: GPS receivers are becoming increasingly common as an objective measure of spatiotemporal movement in free-living populations; however, research into the effects of the surrounding physical environment on the accuracy of off-the-shelf GPS receivers is limited. PURPOSE: The goal of the current study was to (1) determine the static validity of seven portable GPS receiver models under diverse environmental conditions and (2) compare the battery life and signal acquisition times among the models. METHODS: Seven GPS models (three units of each) were placed on six geodetic sites subject to a variety of environmental conditions (e.g., open sky, high-rise buildings) on three separate occasions. The observed signal acquisition time and battery life of each unit were compared to advertised specifications. Data were collected and analyzed in June 2012. RESULTS: Substantial variation in positional error was observed among the seven GPS models, ranging from 12.1 ± 19.6 m to 58.8 ± 393.2 m when averaged across the three test periods and six geodetic sites. Further, mean error varied considerably among sites: the lowest error occurred at the site under open sky (7.3 ± 27.7 m), with the highest error at the site situated between high-rise buildings (59.2 ± 99.2 m). While observed signal acquisition times were generally longer than advertised, the differences between observed and advertised battery life were less pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that portable GPS receivers are able to accurately monitor static spatial location in unobstructed but not obstructed conditions. It also was observed that signal acquisition times were generally underestimated in advertised specifications.},

However, the use of GPS in free-living conditions is not without challenges and the aim of this study was to test the dynamic accuracy of a portable GPS device under real-world environmental conditions, for four modes of transport, and using three data collection intervals. We selected four routes on different bearings, passing through a variation of environmental conditions in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark, to test the dynamic accuracy of the Qstarz BT-Q1000XT GPS device. Each route consisted of a walk, bicycle, and vehicle lane in each direction. The actual width of each walking, cycling, and vehicle lane was digitized as accurately as possible using ultra-high-resolution aerial photographs as background. For each trip, we calculated the percentage that actually fell within the lane polygon, and within the 2.5, 5, and 10 m buffers respectively, as well as the mean and median error in meters. Our results showed that 49.6\% of all ≈68,000 GPS points fell within 2.5 m of the expected location, 78.7\% fell within 10 m and the median error was 2.9 m. The median error during walking trips was 3.9, 2.0 m for bicycle trips, 1.5 m for bus, and 0.5 m for car. The different area types showed considerable variation in the median error: 0.7 m in open areas, 2.6 m in half-open areas, and 5.2 m in urban canyons. The dynamic spatial accuracy of the tested device is not perfect, but we feel that it is within acceptable limits for larger population studies. Longer recording periods, for a larger population are likely to reduce the potentially negative effects of measurement inaccuracy. Furthermore, special care should be taken when the environment in which the study takes place could compromise the GPS signal.},

	abstract = {Accuracy and robustness with respect to missing or corrupt input data are two key characteristics for any travel time prediction model that is to be applied in a real-time environment (e.g. for display on variable message signs on freeways). This article proposes a freeway travel time prediction framework that exhibits both qualities. The framework exploits a recurrent neural network topology, the so-called state-space neural network (SSNN), with preprocessing strategies based on imputation. Although the SSNN model is a neural network, its design (in terms of input- and model selection) is not “black box” nor location-specific. Instead, it is based on the lay-out of the freeway stretch of interest. In this sense, the SSNN model combines the generality of neural network approaches, with traffic related (“white-box”) design. Robustness to missing data is tackled by means of simple imputation (data replacement) schemes, such as exponential forecasts and spatial interpolation. Although there are clear theoretical shortcomings to “simple” imputation schemes to remedy input failure, our results indicate that their use is justified in this particular application. The SSNN model appears to be robust to the “damage” done by these imputation schemes. This is true for both incidental (random) and structural input failure. We demonstrate that the SSNN travel time prediction framework yields good accurate and robust travel time predictions on both synthetic and real data.},

In particular, dealing with missing spatiotemporal data presents an enormous challenge. Nonetheless, in recent years, a considerable amount of research has focused on spatiotemporal problems, making spatiotemporal missing data imputation methods increasingly indispensable. In this paper, a novel spatiotemporal hybrid method is proposed to verify and imputed spatiotemporal missing values. This new method, termed SOM-FLSSVM, flexibly combines three advanced techniques: self-organizing feature map (SOM) clustering, the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). We employ a cross-validation (CV) procedure and FOA swarm intelligence optimization strategy that can search available parameters and determine the optimal imputation model. The spatiotemporal underground water data for Minqin County, China, were selected to test the reliability and imputation ability of SOM-FLSSVM. We carried out a validation experiment and compared three well-studied models with SOM-FLSSVM using a different missing data ratio from 0.1 to 0.8 in the same data set. The results demonstrate that the new hybrid method performs well in terms of both robustness and accuracy for spatiotemporal missing data.},

	abstract = {Missing values occur frequently in many different statistical applications and need to be dealt with-carefully, especially when the data are collected spatio-temporally. We propose a method called CUTOFF imputation that utilizes the spatio-temporal nature of the data to accurately and efficiently impute missing values. The main feature of this method is that the estimate of a missing value is produced by incorporating similar observed temporal information from the value's nearest spatial neighbors. Extensions to this method are also developed to expand the method's ability to accommodate other data generating processes. We develop a cross-validation procedure that optimally chooses parameters for CUTOFF, which can be used by other imputation methods as well. We analyze some rainfall data from 78 gauging stations in the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia using the CUTOFF imputation method and compare its performance to four well-studied competing imputation methods, namely, k-nearest neighbors, singular value decomposition, multiple imputation and random forest. Empirical results show that our method captures the temporal patterns well and is effective at imputing large gaps in the data. Compared to the competing methods, CUTOFF is more accurate and much faster. We analyze further examples to demonstrate CUTOFF's applications to two different data sets and provide extra evidence of its validity and usefulness. We implement a simulation study based on the Murray-Darling Basin data to evaluate the method; the results show that our method performs well in both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

This CTDS approach allows for the joint modeling of location-based as well as directional drivers of movement. Changing behavior over time is modeled using a varying-coefficient framework which maintains the computational simplicity of a GLM approach, and variable selection is accomplished using a group lasso penalty.

The ability to track individuals in great spatial detail by means of Location Aware Technologies such as GPS has opened avenues for gathering these data with great precision. Route reconstruction with positional data is typically done by a process referred to as map-matching; however, despite the large number of real-time map-matching algorithms developed, few studies have developed a post-processing map-matching algorithm in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-environment. This paper presents two GIS-based map-matching methods that predominantly use a digital road network with speed and directionality attributes for route reconstruction of raw GPS-trajectories. The methodologies were tested for a data set in which actual routes travelled were known. Both explored procedures, the ‘Connected Subset’ assignment procedure based on network subset selection and the ‘Impedance Reduction’ assignment procedure based on attribute adjustment, provide accurate results. In addition, both procedures effectively deal with commonly GPS-induced problems such as measurement gaps and positional drift.},

	abstract = {The techniques for data analyses have been widely developed in past years, however, missing data still represent a ubiquitous problem in many scientific fields. In particular, dealing with missing spatiotemporal data presents an enormous challenge. Nonetheless, in recent years, a considerable amount of research has focused on spatiotemporal problems, making spatiotemporal missing data imputation methods increasingly indispensable. In this paper, a novel spatiotemporal hybrid method is proposed to verify and imputed spatiotemporal missing values. This new method, termed SOM-FLSSVM, flexibly combines three advanced techniques: self-organizing feature map (SOM) clustering, the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). We employ a cross-validation (CV) procedure and FOA swarm intelligence optimization strategy that can search available parameters and determine the optimal imputation model. The spatiotemporal underground water data for Minqin County, China, were selected to test the reliability and imputation ability of SOM-FLSSVM. We carried out a validation experiment and compared three well-studied models with SOM-FLSSVM using a different missing data ratio from 0.1 to 0.8 in the same data set. The results demonstrate that the new hybrid method performs well in terms of both robustness and accuracy for spatiotemporal missing data.},
