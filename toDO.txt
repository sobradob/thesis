Latitude, Longitude, Accuracy, Time. 

#Plot optionL day in 24 hours with amount of measurements per each day in the data set.
Each day is one dot, the amount of measurements are between 0 and infinate within one 5 minute slot.

PLots:
two plots: feb 15 with number of measurements with missing in red.
feb 15 with accuracy on y axis day on x axis.

# Check Barnett's notation and use it. 

Filtering methods accuracy, explain how we will filter the data and then combine it with an imputation method to compare effects.
