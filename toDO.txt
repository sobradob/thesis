Trace data
add notation after intro, we will devide the measurements into epochs, and define missing data as a 5 minute slot where the data is missing.
Latitude, Longitude, Accuracy, Time. 

#Plot optionL day in 24 hours with amount of measurements per each day in the data set.
Each day is one dot, the amount of measurements are between 0 and infinate within one 5 minute slot.

PLots:
two plots: feb 15 with number of measurements with missing in red.
feb 15 with accuracy on y axis day on x axis.

# Check Barnett's notation and use it. 

Filtering methods accuracy, explain how we will filter the data and then combine it with an imputation method to compare effects. 

How far from true location in M. Barnett evaluation of accuracy for distance.

Fill table.

Add more introduction, merge it with problem description, write very explicitly each paragraph.

Imagemagick fixed, perhaps create new plot explaining data types. 

Added APA version, citations are broken


Plots
add lables to journey beginnings. See accuracy dist plot script
